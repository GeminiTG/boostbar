<h1>peanut butter</h1>

<p>
    Okay. I feel like this goes without saying, but it's peanut 
    butter so obviously there are peanuts in this item. You can't
    sue us and be like "oh! these guys suck they put peanuts in this 
    item and didn't tell us!"
</p>
<h2>it's in the name, fucknugget. learn to read.</h2>
<p>
    Anyways. The peanut butter flavor is my least favorite,
    personally, but that's just because I don't like peanut butter.
    Not alergic to it or anything. Just not really a fan, yknow?
    But that's okay, to each their own, truly.
</p>
<p>
    But whatever the case, it is still very popular among the
    peanut butter enjoyers in the world. It is our third most popular 
    flavor... ignoring the fact that we only have 3 flavors. Don't worry 
    about that. It's still immensly popular. Totally. Definitely. We're
    telling the truth because, you know...
</p>
<h1>We would never lie to you.</h1>
<p>
    Anyways... what else do I need to mention?
    Right! Yes! Made up stastics! I do not remember the statistics
    of the other 2 so these will probably be different. These have
    20 grams of sugar, 68 grams of protien and 2 chocolate chips (yum yum yum!)
