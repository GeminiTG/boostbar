    Are you ready for more made up statistics? No? Well... too bad.
    I like making up statistics. It's fun, yknow. It really is.
    Did you know that 69% of statistics are made up? It's true. 
    Trust me, bro.

    All the mint in our mint chocolate boostbars are locally sourced!
    We're not toally sure where, to be honest, but our factories say it,
    and obviously our factories would never lie to us... right?
</p>
<h1> RIGHT?</h1>
<p>
    Okay, okay, okay... take a breather, it's okay...
</p>

    Anyways, in our studies, we found that a lot of people don't
    actually like mint naturally. So, while these also have 23 grams
    of protien, these have nearly twice as much sugar as the chocolate
    chip ones at 25 grams. And occasionally 1 chocolate chip.

    Mistakes happen, it's okay.
